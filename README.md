# Homework 2
## **Create Portfolio Website using Responsive Web Design**

As part of this homework, I developed Portfolio website using Bootstrap CSS Framework and grid layouts to create a mobile responsive portfolio. All webpages of this website use semantic HTML tags and are validated via HTML validation service. 

## Files

* contact.html (Page title - Contact)
* portfolio.html (Page title - Portfolio)
* Images/ folder (contains all images used by the portfolio website)
* css/style.css (Stylesheet used by portfolio website)  
  

## Deployment Details

_Website is deployed on Github ([Repository link](https://github.com/garimaggupta/hw2)) and can be accessed via the following link_: [Garima's Portfolio](https://garimaggupta.github.io/hw2/)
